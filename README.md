# glass-vs-no-glass-classification



The course's final project requires  us  to  build  a  model  capable  of  classifying  a  dataset  of  images with glasses and images with no-glasses. The initial models used were Logistic Regression, Principal Component Analysis, LinearDiscriminant  Analysis  and  Random  Forest  Classifier.  The  Data  set  is  provided  to  us  having  approximately  6000  images.  We analysed  the  data  set.  We  analysed  the  performance  of  different  classifiers  on  the  data-set.  We  evaluated the  entire  pipeline with cross validation
